This is a startling film that gives you a fascinating, albeit depressing view of Iranian rural life close to the Iraqi border.A few artsy flourishes aside, Narc is as gritty as a movie gets these days.While The Isle is both preposterous and thoroughly misogynistic, its vistas are incredibly beautiful to look at.Together, Tok and O orchestrate a buoyant, darkly funny dance of death.In the process, they demonstrate that there's still a lot of life in Hong Kong cinema.Director Kapur is a filmmaker with a real flair for epic landscapes and adventure, and this is a better film than his earlier English-language movie, the overpraised Elizabeth.The movie is a blast of educational energy, as bouncy animation and catchy songs escort you through the entire 85 minutes.A sports movie with action that's exciting on the field and a story you care about off it.Doug Liman, the director of Bourne, directs the traffic well, gets a nice wintry look from his locations, absorbs us with the movie's spycraft and uses Damon's ability to be focused and sincere.The tenderness of the piece is still intact.Katz uses archival footage, horrifying documents of lynchings, still photographs and charming old reel-to-reel recordings of Meeropol entertaining his children to create his song history, but most powerful of all is the song itself
Like the film's almost anthropologically detailed realization of early-'80s suburbia, it's significant without being overstated.While McFarlane's animation lifts the film firmly above the level of other coming-of-age films .. it's also so jarring that it's hard to get back into the boys' story.If nothing else, this movie introduces a promising, unusual kind of psychological horror.In a normal screen process, these bromides would be barely enough to sustain an interstitial program on the Discovery Channel.But in Imax 3-D, the clich√©s disappear into the vertiginous perspectives opened up by the photography.Writer-director Burger imaginatively fans the embers of a dormant national grief and curiosity that has calcified into chronic cynicism and fear....a roller-coaster ride of a movie
I enjoyed Time of Favor while I was watching it, but I was surprised at how quickly it faded from my memory.Chicago is sophisticated, brash, sardonic, completely joyful in its execution.Steve Irwin's method is Ernest Hemmingway at accelerated speed and volume.A refreshing Korean film about five female high school friends who face an uphill battle when they try to take their relationships into deeper waters.On the surface, it's a lovers-on-the-run crime flick, but it has a lot in common with Piesiewicz's and Kieslowski's earlier work, films like The Double Life of Veronique.
