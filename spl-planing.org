* Steps
  - Take input from file
  - Make a med word.
  - Find spelling errors.
  - [X] Adding Header files.
* Days
** 9 Feb - Make language model 
   String matching.
   So find the string/sentence in the text file.
   Count number of matches.
*** Issues
    - fscanf(fptr,"%s %s",two_word)
    - Create a file with 10 "you have"
    - Possible factor: punctuation
** 10 Feb - Know about scanf
   So the punctuations were creating problems for us. To handle them, we need scanf
   - Issues
*** DONE Not enough heap
    Its not heap issue because adding more words cause no issue.
*** index becomes 0
*** not allocated properly
** 14 Feb - Porter, Complete it today!
   - Make a function to find m value
   - make condition functions
   - Make a replace function
** 3March - Edit All files [5/9]
   - [X] auxiliary.cpp
   - [X] bigram.cpp
   - [ ] find_string_match.cpp

*** Issues
    - Flycheck can not detect iostream

* Caution!
  our bigram only works for mtl and speech recognition. Due to ~stemming~, it can no longer identify grammatical errors.
