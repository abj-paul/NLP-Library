* Vector
** Reverse()
  - Reverse function working fine.

* Stemmer
  - A lot of negative index access.
* Steps
  - [X] Made direction public and used it.
  - [X] Whats causing this infinite loop thing? Erase function? NOPE. Its what we push back. WE pushed back the old word (fore*5). As a result, the number of such words will just keep increasing infinitely.
  - [ ] Verify the header file. (RUN and check)
  - [ ] Load and print the confusion matrices
  - [ ] Make a small function inside confusion matrix class where you run med on two words and return the log probablity.
