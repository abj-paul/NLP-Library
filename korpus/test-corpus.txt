n 2006, law professor Elizabeth Warren, now a United States senator, published “All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan” with her daughter, economist Amelia Warren Tyagi. One of the key concepts in this book was the balanced money formula. It divided all spending into three categories: must-haves, wants, and savings. 

Warren and Tyagi define must-haves as bills you have to pay no matter what. All the basics, like rent, transportation, insurance, and utilities, go into this category. By contrast, the wants category includes “all the treats and extras,” such as clothes, movies, and restaurant meals.

The Warren-Tyagi formula approaches needs rather differently from the Gallup poll. For instance, both classify housing as a necessity. But for Gallup, meeting your housing needs means having “adequate shelter” in a safe neighborhood. For Warren and Tyagi, your housing must-have is enough money to cover your rent or mortgage, no matter how large it is.

Similarly, your must-have list could include a car payment and auto insurance even though a vehicle isn’t one of the basic needs on the Gallup list. That’s because even if a car isn’t a necessity for you, once you’ve bought one, paying the bills for it becomes one.  

In other words, your must-haves aren’t the bare necessities of all human life. They’re the specific necessities of your life as you’re living it right now.

That means that unlike Gallup’s list of basic necessities, your must-have list can change. Warren and Tyagi emphasize that living on a budget often requires you to cut spending on must-haves, as well as wants. 

Paying your rent or mortgage is a necessity. But if you’re spending more than half your income on the mortgage for a new house that’s too big for you, that’s a necessity you can’t afford. Downsizing can rebalance your budget while still meeting your basic need for housing.
