267     Windtalkers is shapelessly gratifying , the kind of movie that invites you to pick apart its faults even as you have to admit that somehow it hit you where you live .
412     The people in Dogtown and Z-Boys are so funny , aggressive and alive , you have to watch them because you ca n't wait to see what they do next .
2337    Even if you have no interest in the gang-infested , East-vs .
2708    If you have n't seen the film lately , you may be surprised at the variety of tones in Spielberg 's work .
2949    One of those unassuming films that sneaks up on you and stays with you long after you have left the theatre .
